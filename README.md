Palindrome Checker

Welcome to my Palindrome Checker project! This is a Java-based console application that I created to determine whether a given word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. With this application, I wanted to provide a simple and interactive way for users to check multiple words and receive immediate feedback on whether each word is a palindrome.

Features:
User-Friendly Interface: I designed the application with a straightforward command-line interface that prompts users for input.
Continuous Input: Users can check multiple words without having to restart the program.
Case Insensitivity: The program treats uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent, ensuring accurate palindrome detection regardless of letter case.
Immediate Feedback: For each input word, the application displays the reversed version and indicates whether it is a palindrome.
Exit Option: Users can easily terminate the program by entering a specific command.

The program will reverse the word and display the reversed version.
It will then compare the reversed word to the original to check for palindrome properties.
Finally, the program will output whether the entered word is a palindrome or not.

Example Interaction:
If you enter the word "radar":
The program will respond with: "radar is a palindrome."
If you enter the word "hello":
The program will respond with: "hello is not a palindrome."
If you type "0" to exit:
The program will output: "Program stopped."

Code Structure:
The Palindrome Checker consists of a single Java class that I developed to handle user input and logic:

PalindromeChecker Class: 
This class contains the main method, where user interaction occurs. It manages the input loop, palindrome checking logic, and output display.
